= Password Store =

By tarmack (bart@tarmack.eu)

== What is it? ==

A password store where you are able to have multiple password repositories, personal and shared. It must do encryption client- and server-side..

This system should be able to talk with a web interface as well as trough an API to enable people to build their own interfaces (such browser extensions).

== Why? ==

There are alternatives (such as KeePass), but they are lacking security security in the web version: for example, they use the same salt for everything and every user. They are also not meant to be used by more than one user at a time: when you want to have a shared file to solve above problems, only one can write at a time.

== Use cases ==
